            "description": "Your company has decided to make a major revision of their API in order to create better experiences for their developers. They need to keep the old version of the API available and deployable, while allowing new customers and testers to try out the new API. They want to keep the same SSL and DNS records in place to serve both APIs. What should they do?",

                "Configure a new load balancer",
                "Reconfigure old clients",
                "Have the old API forward traffic to the new API based on the path",
                "Use separate backend pools for each API path behind the load balancer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": "Use separate backend pools for each API path behind the load balancer",
            "feedback": {
                "Configure a new load balancer": "Incorrect. This would require a new IP address, which in turn would necessitate new DNS/SSL records, violating a key requirement.",
                "Reconfigure old clients": "Incorrect. This is not a scalable or practical solution and would cause significant disruption to existing users of the old API.",
                "Have the old API forward traffic to the new API based on the path": "Incorrect. This approach is risky as it creates a dependency between the two API versions, making independent deployments difficult and increasing the chance of cascading failures.",
                "Use separate backend pools for each API path behind the load balancer": "Correct! An HTTP(S) Load Balancer supports path-based routing. You can configure it to send traffic for '/v1/*' to the old backend pool and '/v2/*' to the new one, all while using the same DNS name and SSL certificate."
